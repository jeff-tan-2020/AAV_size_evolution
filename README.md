**AAV Genome Size Optimization via Machine Learning**

Developed a machine learning pipeline to suggest capsid mutations that increase DNA packaging capacity in AAV9. Collected evolutionary parvovirus data using Biopython, extracted protein structure features via Meta’s ESMfold, and engineered an XGBoost regression model to predict genome size from capsid mutations using a Top-N search algorithm.
